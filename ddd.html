        exactly the place I've been looking for all my life. A little hideaway in
        some sinkhole somewhere. I'd always thought of it as a secret, imaginary
        and can barely believe that it actually exists. I close my eyes and
        take a breath, and wonder of it all settles over me like a gentle cloud."
